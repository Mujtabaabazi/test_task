<em>2. For the purpose of 1A007.b the detonators of concern all utilize a small electrical conductor (bridge, bridge wire, or foil) that explosively vaporizes when a fast, high-current electrical pulse is passed through it. In nonslapper types, the exploding conductor starts a chemical detonation in a contacting high explosive material such as PETN (pentaerythritoltetranitrate). In slapper detonators, the explosive vaporization of the electrical conductor drives a flyer or slapper across a gap, and the impact of the slapper on an explosive starts a chemical detonation. The slapper in some designs is driven by magnetic force. The term exploding foil detonator may refer to either an EB or a slapper-type detonator.</em>

Precursor chemicals of the same structural formula (e.g., hydrates) are controlled by ECCN 1C350, regardless of name or CAS number. CAS numbers are shown to assist in identifying whether a particular precursor chemical or mixture is controlled under ECCN 1C350, irrespective of nomenclature. However, CAS numbers cannot be used as unique identifiers in all situations because some forms of the listed precursor chemical have different CAS numbers, and mixtures containing a precursor chemical listed in ECCN 1C350 may also have different CAS numbers.</em>

</div>
<p>
<em>1. Secondary parallel contouring axes, (e.g., the w-axis on horizontal boring mills or a secondary rotary axis the center line of which is parallel to the primary rotary axis) are not counted in the total number of contouring axes. Rotary axes need not rotate over 360°. A rotary axis can be driven by a linear device (e.g., a screw or a rack-and-pinion).</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>2. The number of axes which can be coordinated simultaneously for “contouring control” is the number of axes along or around which, during processing of the workpiece, simultaneous and interrelated motions are performed between the workpiece and a tool. This does not include any additional axes along or around which other relative motions within the machine are performed, such as:</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>2.a. Wheel-dressing systems in grinding machines;</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>2.b. Parallel rotary axes designed for mounting of separate workpieces;</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>2.c. Co-linear rotary axes designed for manipulating the same workpiece by holding it in a chuck from different ends.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>3. Axis nomenclature shall be in accordance with International Standard ISO 841:2001, Industrial automation systems and integration - Numerical control of machines - Coordinate system and motion nomenclature.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>4. A “tilting spindle” is counted as a rotary axis.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>5. 'Stated “unidirectional positioning repeatability” ' may be used for each specific machine model as an alternative to individual machine tests, and is determined as follows:</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>5.a. Select five machines of a model to be evaluated;</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>5.b. Measure the linear axis repeatability (R↑,R↓) according to ISO 230-2:2014 and evaluate “unidirectional positioning repeatability” for each axis of each of the five machines;</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>5.c. Determine the arithmetic mean value of the ”unidirectional positioning repeatability”-values for each axis of all five machines together. These arithmetic mean values “unidirectional positioning repeatability” (UPR) become the stated value of each axis for the model...) (UPR</em><sub>X</sub>
<em>, UPR</em><sub>y</sub>
<em>, . . .);</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>5.d. Since the Category 2 list refers to each linear axis there will be as many 'stated “unidirectional positioning repeatability” ' values as there are linear axes;</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>5.e. If any axis of a machine model not controlled by 2B001.a. to 2B001.c. has a 'stated “unidirectional positioning repeatability” ' equal to or less than the specified “unidirectional positioning repeatability” of each machine tool model plus 0.7 µm, the builder should be required to reaffirm the accuracy level once every eighteen months.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>6. For the purpose of 2B, measurement uncertainty for the “unidirectional positioning repeatability” of machine tools, as defined in the International Standard ISO 230-2:2014, shall not be considered.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>7. For the purpose of 2B, the measurement of axes shall be made according to test procedures in 5.3.2. of ISO 230-2:2014. Tests for axes longer than 2 meters shall be made over 2 m segments. Axes longer than 4 m require multiple tests (e.g., two tests for axes longer than 4 m and up to 8 m, three tests for axes longer than 8 m and up to 12 m), each over 2 m segments and distributed in equal intervals over the axis length. Test segments are equally spaced along the full axis length, with any excess length equally divided at the beginning, in between, and at the end of the test segments. The smallest “unidirectional positioning repeatability”-value of all test segments is to be reported.</em>

<em>1. In a scroll compressor or vacuum pump, crescent-shaped pockets of gas are trapped between one or more pairs of intermeshed spiral vanes, or scrolls, one of which moves while the other remains stationary. The moving scroll orbits the stationary scroll; it does not rotate. As the moving scroll orbits the stationary scroll, the gas pockets diminish in size (i.e., they are compressed) as they move toward the outlet port of the machine.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>2. In a bellows-sealed scroll compressor or vacuum pump, the process gas is totally isolated from the lubricated parts of the pump and from the external atmosphere by a metal bellows. One end of the bellows is attached to the moving scroll and the other end is attached to the stationary housing of the pump.</em>

<em>Technical Note to Table on Deposition Techniques:</em>
</div>
<p>
<em>Processes specified in Column 1 of the Table are defined as follows:</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>a. Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) is an overlay coating or surface modification coating process wherein a metal, alloy, “composite”, dielectric or ceramic is deposited upon a heated substrate. Gaseous reactants are decomposed or combined in the vicinity of a substrate resulting in the deposition of the desired elemental, alloy or compound material on the substrate. Energy for this decomposition or chemical reaction process may be provided by the heat of the substrate, a glow discharge plasma, or “laser” irradiation.</em>
</p>
</div><div class="note">
<div class="header">
<em>Note 1:</em>
</div>
<p><em>CVD includes the following processes: Directed gas flow out-of-pack deposition, pulsating CVD, controlled nucleation thermal decomposition (CNTD), plasma enhanced or plasma assisted CVD processes</em>.</p>
</div><div class="note">
<div class="header">
<em>Note 2:</em>
</div>
<p>
<em>Pack denotes a substrate immersed in a powder mixture.</em>
</p>
</div><div class="note">
<div class="header">
<em>Note 3:</em>
</div>
<p>
<em>The gaseous reactants used in the out-of-pack process are produced using the same basic reactions and parameters as the pack cementation process, except that the substrate to be coated is not in contact with the powder mixture.</em>
</p>
</div><p>
<em>b. Thermal Evaporation-Physical Vapor Deposition (TE-PVD) is an overlay coating process conducted in a vacuum with a pressure less than 0.1 Pa wherein a source of thermal energy is used to vaporize the coating material. This process results in the condensation, or deposition, of the evaporated species onto appropriately positioned substrates. The addition of gases to the vacuum chamber during the coating process to synthesize compound coatings is an ordinary modification of the process. The use of ion or electron beams, or plasma, to activate or assist the coating's deposition is also a common modification in this technique. The use of monitors to provide in-process measurement of optical characteristics and thickness of coatings can be a feature of these processes. Specific TE-PVD processes are as follows:</em>
</p><p>
<em>1. Electron Beam PVD uses an electron beam to heat and evaporate the material which forms the coating;</em>
</p><p>
<em>2. Ion Assisted Resistive Heating PVD employs electrically resistive heating sources in combination with impinging ion beam(s) to produce a controlled and uniform flux of evaporated coating species;</em>
</p><p>
<em>3. “Laser” Vaporization uses either pulsed or continuous wave “laser” beams to vaporize the material which forms the coating;</em>
</p><p>
<em>4. Cathodic Arc Deposition employs a consumable cathode of the material which forms the coating and has an arc discharge established on the surface by a momentary contact of a ground trigger. Controlled motion of arcing erodes the cathode surface creating a highly ionized plasma. The anode can be either a cone attached to the periphery of the cathode, through an insulator, or the chamber. Substrate biasing is used for non line-of-sight deposition;</em>
</p><div class="note">
<div class="header">
<em>Note:</em>
</div>
<p>
<em> This definition does not include random cathodic arc deposition with non-biased substrates.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>5. Ion Plating is a special modification of a general TE-PVD process in which a plasma or an ion source is used to ionize the species to be deposited, and a negative bias is applied to the substrate in order to facilitate the extraction of the species from the plasma. The introduction of reactive species, evaporation of solids within the process chamber, and the use of monitors to provide in-process measurement of optical characteristics and thicknesses of coatings are ordinary modifications of the process.</em>

<p>
<em>c. Pack Cementation is a surface modification coating or overlay coating process wherein a substrate is immersed in a powder mixture (a pack), that consists of:</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>1. The metallic powders that are to be deposited (usually aluminum, chromium, silicon or combinations thereof);</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>2. An activator (normally a halide salt); and</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>3. An inert powder, most frequently alumina.</em>
